                <p>Hello! My name is Obodo Joshua but my friends called me JoshGenius.<br> I am from Delta state, Nigeria.
                    I enjoy playing video games, analyzing them and making them!<br> I'm currently working on a puzzle-platformer video game
                    that has to do with telporting and strategic thinking,<br> you can check my <a href="https://youtube.com/@genfisoft">yt channel</a> to get more info concerning the game.
                    I've always wanted to make a website <br> and I believe this journey is going to be a fruitful one.
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks for reading...
